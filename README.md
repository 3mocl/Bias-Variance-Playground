# Bias-Variance Playground for College ML Courses

### üóìÔ∏è Jul 2024 - Present

I‚Äôm currently developing an interactive **Bias-Variance Tradeoff Playground** using Next.js, crafted to elevate the learning experience for around 200 students at Lawrence University and The College of Idaho. This cutting-edge application brings complex data modeling scenarios to life, allowing users to:

- **Simulate and Explore**: Adjust variables like dataset size, noise levels, and model complexity to see their effects on bias, variance, and MSE.
- **Visualize**: Utilize dynamic scatterplots and real-time graph updates that replicate advanced statistical modeling in R.
- **Learn by Doing**: Gain hands-on experience with machine learning concepts in an engaging, interactive environment.

Key features:
- **Interactive Simulations**: Manipulate various parameters and instantly see the results.
- **Real-Time Visuals**: Dynamic updates to scatterplots and graphs that help demystify the bias-variance tradeoff.

This project is designed to provide students with a practical understanding of machine learning concepts through direct interaction with data and models.
